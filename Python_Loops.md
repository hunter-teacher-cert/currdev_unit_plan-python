# UNIT PLAN NAME: Unit 4: # Repetition and Loops in Python
by Mamudu Wally

-----

## General Overview
Iterations and Loops are essential for learning tools for any algorithm. I would like my students to learn about while loops, iteration and for loops in this unit.
The unit will be covered as the fourth unit when students learned about variables, basic calculations, sequencing and selection (if, if-else, else-if statements) in Python.

## Motivation for Unit
Upon successful completion of this lesson, students will be able to define and code for loops, while loops and variable control loops.

## Standards Referenced
This lesson adheres to the following CSTA Standards: 3B-AP-14

4-6.CT.4- Decompose a problem into smaller named tasks, some of which can themselves be decomposed into smaller steps.

9-12.CT.5- Modify a function or procedure in a program to perform its computation in a different way over the same inputs, while preserving the result of the overall program.

7-8.CT.5- Identify multiple similar concrete computations in a program, then create a function to generalize over them using parameters to accommodate their differences

4-6.CT.5- Identify and name a task within a problem that gets performed multiple times while solving that problem, but with slightly different concrete details each time.

9-12.CT.6- Demonstrate how at least two classic algorithms work, and analyze the trade-offs related to two or more algorithms for completing the same task.

4-6.CT.7- Identify pieces of information that might change as a program or process runs.

4-6.CT.8- Develop algorithms or programs that use repetition and conditionals for creative expression or to solve a problem.

7-8.CT.8- Develop or remix a program that effectively combines one or more control structures for creative expression or to solve a problem.

7-8.CT.10- Document the iterative design process of developing a computational artifact that incorporates user feedback and preferences.

7-8.CY.3- Describe trade-offs of implementing specific security safeguards.


9-12.DL.2- Communicate and work collaboratively with others using digital tools to support individual learning and contribute to the learning of others.

7-8.DL.5- Transfer knowledge of technology in order to explore new technologies.

7-8.DL.2- Communicate and collaborate with others using a variety of digital tools to create and revise a collaborative product.

## Tools Used
This course is taught using Python. Python is a general-purpose programming language great for beginners. It is most praised for its elegant syntax and readable code, and it's quite powerful. Python is used by many large organizations, including Google and NASA, to do just about everything: including building apps, analyzing data, and system administration. Python will be the programming language that you use in both the Project STEM programming environment and in EarSketch. Pear Deck presentation!!
