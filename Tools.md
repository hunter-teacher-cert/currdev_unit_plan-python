Pear Deck flips the traditional lecture by actively engaging students in real-time. Ask questions. 
Students answer. Want to use Pear Deck in your class? Here's how. 

The standard lecture has plenty of detractors, and rightfully so. 
Done poorly, it can be an uninspired stream of facts, delivered in sit-and-get style that get forgotten quickly.

However, we can turn the standard lecture — and its tool of choice, the presentation slide! — on its head.

The result can be students actively working with new ideas. Hands-on. Right away.

Presentation slides can be a drag.

But when students (and teachers!) have something interactive to do with them, it changes the game.

That’s what I love about Pear Deck. And, of course, the best news: much of what I show you in this post can be done with the free plan!
