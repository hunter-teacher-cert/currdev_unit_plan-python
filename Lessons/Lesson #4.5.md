4.5 Review Loops
# Introduction
As we learned earlier in this unit, a loop is a programming command used to repeat code. There are two basic types of loops: a user-controlled loop and a count loop.
A user-controlled loop asks the user to input information until a test condition is met. The user may enter one piece of information; they might enter thousands of pieces of information. The number of times a user-controlled loop will repeat is variable and unknown when the loop begins running.
A count loop uses a count variable to count the number of times the loop will repeat. This count variable is also known as the loop control variable. The number of times a count loop will repeat is known before the loop even begins running.
