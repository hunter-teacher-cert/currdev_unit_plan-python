# 4.5 While Loops
# Introduction
As we learned earlier in this unit, a loop is a programming command used to repeat code. There are two basic types of loops: a user-controlled loop and a count loop.
A user-controlled loop asks the user to input information until a test condition is met. The user may enter one piece of information; they might enter thousands of pieces of information. The number of times a user-controlled loop will repeat is variable and unknown when the loop begins running.
A count loop uses a count variable to count the number of times the loop will repeat. This count variable is also known as the loop control variable. The number of times a count loop will repeat is known before the loop even begins running.

# Learning Target:
Students will be able to Code two types of while loops.

# Practice Code Example #1:

Loop Control Variable

word = “empty”

while (word != "STOP"):
 
 word = input ("Enter a word, STOP to end the loop.")
 
 print("You entered: " + word)

User Controlled Loop

● Here, word is a loop control variable.

● This is the variable used to stop the loop from repeating.

● This loop repeats until the user enters STOP - we don’t know how many times it will repeat ahead of time.

# Practice Code Example #2:


Count Variable Loop

c = 0

while (c < 10):
 
 c = c+1
 
 print(c)

Count Variable Loop

● Here, c is a loop control variable

● This loop repeats exactly 10 times

A count loop uses a count variable to count the number of times the loop will repeat. This count variable is also known as the loop control variable. The number of times a count loop will repeat is known before the loop even begins running.
