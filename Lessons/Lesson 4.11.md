4.11 Modeling and Simulation

Introduction
In this lesson, students learn how computer models and computer simulations can help predict and test real-world situations. The students will: Be able to define computer models and simulations and explain why these are used Be able to explain the two key features used to create simulations Components: Video Lesson Lesson Practice What to Emphasize: A computer model is used to replicate a phenomenon in the world and a simulation is running the model repeatedly while changing variables to predict what will happen in the future. Most simulations will use random numbers and large scale repetition Additional Notes: Modeling and simulation is a staple in all areas. Some reasons to use simulations and modeling is when the real testing is not feasible because of money, safety, time or technology. If you'd like to customize the lesson slides, click here.
