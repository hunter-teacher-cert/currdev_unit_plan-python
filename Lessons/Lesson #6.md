What to Emphasize:
The range function can be used in a for loop in order to determine not only how many times a program will run, but which values will be stored to the i variable. Ex: for i in range(1, 10, 2) would run 5 times, and would store the values of 1, 3, 5, 7, and 9 to i each time through the loop.
Range can be used to count up, count down and to count by different amounts besides 1 at a time.
Additional Notes:
Although you will frequently see the range function used with a for loop, there are other applications of the range function as well.
