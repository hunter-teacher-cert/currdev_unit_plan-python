4.8 Counting by Other Than 1
# Introduction
This lesson explores how a for loop uses parameters to count by numbers other than 1. 
The students will:
Code for loops with control variables that increase or decrease by amounts other than 1
Components:
Video Lesson
Lesson Practice
Code Practice (3)
What to Emphasize:
Although a for loop will run a set amount of times, you are still allowed to get user input inside of the loop.
Typically a for loop looks neater in a program because it requires a few less lines of code.
Additional Notes:
A for loop in other languages like C++ or Javascript look slightly different: for( i = 0; i < 10; i + 2). Even though this looks different, the parts of the for loop are the same. There is a starting point (i = 0), and ending point (i < 10) and how we count (i+2).
