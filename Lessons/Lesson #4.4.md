# 4.4 Data Revisited
# Introduction
This lesson uses recently learned techniques max and min, etc functions to harness various forms of data.

# Learning Target
The students will be able to understand and create the algorithms behind the max and min function.

# Components:

## Lesson Activities
min and max are functions in Python that can find the minimum or maximum of a list of numbers.

a = 5

b = 2

c = 3

smallest = min(a,b,c)  # This stores 2 to the variable smallest

largest = max(a,b,c)  # This stores 5 to the variable largest

>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>.

We've been using functions all along, but have been calling them commands.

Functions are called by their name and can be sent information (in this case, the set of numbers that the program should find the minimum or maximum of) in between in the parentheses. These inputs entered between the parentheses, separated by commas, are parameters.

Packaging code into functions allows your code to be re-used multiple times throughout your program. It is useful for functions to perform a single specific task - like converting a temperature from Celsius to Fahrenheit - as opposed to performing many tasks all at one time. 
Whenever you get unexpected outputs for your program, feel free to use the Python Tutor Visualization Mode to help step through the program. 

Notice that the variable “max” appears in a dark blue color. Just like with other keywords in Python, print, while, int, input, etc. max is also a keyword. A keyword is a word that is reserved by a program because the word has a special meaning. Python anticipates when you use the word “max” that you will be using the max function - max() - so it changes the color of the word to help it stand out to the programmer. Normally in these instances, you would want to use another variable. What happens if you try to use the words print or if as variables?
