Additional Notes:
Notice in the video how the variable “max” appears in a dark blue color. Just like with other keywords in Python, print, while, int, input, etc. max is also a keyword. A keyword is a word that is reserved by a program because the word has a special meaning. Python anticipates when you use the word “max” that you will be using the max function - max() - so it changes the color of the word to help it stand out to the programmer. Normally in these instances, you would want to use another variable. What happens if you try to use the words print or if as variables?
