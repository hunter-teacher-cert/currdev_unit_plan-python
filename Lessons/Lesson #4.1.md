Components:
Video Lesson
Lesson Practice
Code Practice
What to Emphasize:
The loop control variable must have an opportunity to be changed in a while loop in order for the while loop to end. If the control variable never changes, the loop will be infinite.
The formatting for a while loop is the same as an if statement, where there needs to be a colon after the condition and the code to be executed should be indented underneath.
Additional Notes:
The Viz Mode can be beneficial to help students see how a variable changes throughout a program. This helps them trace through the program and identify where an error may have occurred.
