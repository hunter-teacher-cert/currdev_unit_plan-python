4.7 For Loops
# Introduction
This lesson introduces the for loop, which is a type of count loop that uses the range function to set the value of the loop control variable. 
The students will:
Be able to define and code for loops
Learn when to use a for loop rather than a while loop
Components:
Video Lesson
Lesson Practice
Code Practice (2)
What to Emphasize:
For loops are used only when you know exactly how many times you want the loop to run.
Additional Notes:
Having students create a while AND a for loop that do the same thing can be helpful. Seeing them side-by-side helps to show how each can use a count variable, but in slightly different ways.
