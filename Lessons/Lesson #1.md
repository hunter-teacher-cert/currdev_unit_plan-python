4.1 Loops
# Introduction
In this lesson, students learn about loops. 
The students will:
Be able to define and code while loops and loop control variables 
Components:
Video Lesson
Lesson Practice
Code Practice
What to Emphasize:
The loop control variable must have an opportunity to be changed in a while loop in order for the while loop to end. If the control variable never changes, the loop will be infinite.
The formatting for a while loop is the same as an if statement, where there needs to be a colon after the condition and the code to be executed should be indented underneath.
Additional Notes:
The Viz Mode can be beneficial to help students see how a variable changes throughout a program. This helps them trace through the program and identify where an error may have occurred.

4.10 Review of Algorithms and Tracing
# Introduction
This lesson recalls the lesson on algorithms and code tracing from Unit 3.
The students will:
Be able to define algorithms and code tracing
Be able to explain techniques for tracing code, and successfully trace code to determine behavior and outputs
Components:
Video Lesson
Lesson Practice
What to Emphasize:
In order to understand what is happening in a specific algorithm or program, we trace the code and follow each variable and track how that variable is changing and what it should be doing.
Adding comments into the code to help explain what each step is doing can be helpful during code tracing
Additional Notes:
Even though we are trying to “break” our code with different input values, at this point in time, students do not know how to properly make code work if they enter a string when an integer is expected or a float when an integer is expected. However, if we are expecting a string, checking to make sure a single word works, two words, long and short words, no words, etc.

4.11 Modeling and Simulation
# Introduction
In this lesson, students learn how computer models and computer simulations can help predict and test real-world situations. 
The students will:
Be able to define computer models and simulations and explain why these are used
Be able to explain the two key features used to create simulations
Components:
Video Lesson
Lesson Practice
What to Emphasize:
A computer model is used to replicate a phenomenon in the world and a simulation is running the model repeatedly while changing variables to predict what will happen in the future.
Most simulations will use random numbers and large scale repetition
Additional Notes:
Modeling and simulation is a staple in all areas. Some reasons to use simulations and modeling is when the real testing is not feasible because of money, safety, time or technology.
