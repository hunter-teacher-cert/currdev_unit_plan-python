4.2 Count Variables
# Introduction
This lesson builds on studentsâ€™ knowledge of loops, and introduces count variables, which help keep track of how many times a loop has run.
The students will:
Be able to define initializing 
Be able to define and code the count and sum variables
Components:

Lesson Practice
Code Practice (2)
What to Emphasize:
A count variable must be initialized before using it throughout the program. Most other variables are initialized or set when we get the input from the user, but a count variable is not a user input, so we must initialize it ourselves.
Whenever you are altering a variable, like sum or count, by building off of its current value, the variable appears on both sides of the assignment operator. The alteration to the variable is done on the right side.
Examples:
count = count - 1
sum = sum + number
answer = answer / 4
duplicate = duplicate * 2
Additional Notes:
Counting and summing are very common in programs, so instead of having to use the syntax mentioned above to edit a variables current value there is something called shorthand notation. We can instead use something like this: count += 1 or sum += number. Whenever a math symbol appears right before the assignment operator, Python knows to take the variable on the left and perform the operation with the variable on the right and then assigns it back to the variable on the left.
