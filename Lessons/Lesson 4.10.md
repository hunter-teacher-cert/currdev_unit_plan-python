4.10 Review of Algorithms and Tracing

Introduction
This lesson recalls the lesson on algorithms and code tracing from Unit 3. The students will: Be able to define algorithms and code tracing Be able to explain techniques for tracing code, and successfully trace code to determine behavior and outputs Components: Video Lesson Lesson Practice What to Emphasize: In order to understand what is happening in a specific algorithm or program, we trace the code and follow each variable and track how that variable is changing and what it should be doing. Adding comments into the code to help explain what each step is doing can be helpful during code tracing Additional Notes: Even though we are trying to “break” our code with different input values, at this point in time, students do not know how to properly make code work if they enter a string when an integer is expected or a float when an integer is expected. However, if we are expecting a string, checking to make sure a single word works, two words, long and short words, no words, etc. If you'd like to customize the lesson slides, click here.
