# 4.7 For Loops
# Introduction
This lesson introduces the for loop, which is a type of count loop that uses the range function to set the value of the loop control variable.

# Learning Target

The students will be able to define and code for loops and learn when to use a for loop rather than a while loop.

A for loop is a type of count loop. It uses the range function to set the value of the loop control variable.

There are two cases when you'd use a for loop instead of a while loop:

1. When there is a definite starting and ending point,

2. When you know exactly how many times you want the loop to run,for loops do not replace while loops altogether. 

Remember, there are two types of while loops: user-controlled loops and count loops. The for loop is an alternate to the count loop, but it does not replace a user-controlled loop.

# Code Practice
for i in range (1, 11):
 
 print(i)

● Will Print the numbers from 1 to 10

>>>.

For loops are used only when you know exactly how many times you want the loop to run.

Having students create a while AND a for loop that do the same thing can be helpful. Seeing them side-by-side helps to show how each can use a count variable, but in slightly different ways.
