4.9 Summing
# Introduction
In this lesson, students will learn about summing using a for loop. 
The students will:
Be able to use a for loop with a sum variable to sum a set of variables
Components:
Video Lesson
Lesson Practice
Code Practice (4)
What to Emphasize:
The order of your code is very important inside of a loop. If you find that the output is off a little, but the code looks correct, trace through the code and you may see that some lines of code just need to be switched or moved around.
When using a sum variable, it normally is initialized to 0 before the loop begins. If you do not first initialize it as something, how can you add to it?
Additional Notes:
A variable is initialized whenever it is first assigned a value. However, you cannot use a variable on the right side of an assignment without it first being assigned a value. Ex: x = input(“Name: “) is fine to use even if x is not yet defined, because it is on the left side of the assignment. Ex: x = 4 * r is not okay if r has not yet been initialized - how can I multiply by something I do not know the value of?
