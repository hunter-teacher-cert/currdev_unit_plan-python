4.3 Two Ways to End a Loop
# Introduction
This lesson introduces two ways to end a loop: using a count variable to run a loop a specific number of times, and using user input. 
The students will:
Be able to end loops using count variables and user input
Be able to state when to use them
Components:
Video Lesson
Lesson Practice
Code Practice (2)
What to Emphasize:
Just like when using strings in my control expression, or a user input variable, any variable, including the count variable must change inside the loop in order for the loop to eventually end.
A while loop can run an indefinite amount of times by gathering user input or it can run a set amount of times by controlling it with a count variable.
